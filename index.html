            <p class="mb-3 w-100 justify-content-center">He was born in 1911 in Cornwall and graduated from Oxford University. His collection of poems, "Poems," was published in 1934. In 1954, he earned the Nobel Prize in Literature for his book "Lord of the Flies," known for its allegorical nature. Although subsequent works, especially "Piranha," demonstrated a much stronger literary structure, they did not achieve the same impact as his renowned book. In 1980, he received the Man Booker Prize for his work "Rites of Passage." In 1983, the Swedish Academy awarded him the Nobel Prize in Literature, stating, "This year's award goes to the novelist who skillfully combines reality and myth, thoroughly exploring the spiritual and physical dimensions of humanity." During that time, the British author John Fowles referred to Golding as the "best British writer." Knighted in 1988, Golding passed away in 1993 due to heart failure, leaving an unfinished novel titled "The Double Tongue."</p>

      <p class="px-2">"The Lord of the Flies," written by William Golding, is a dystopian novel that tells the story of a group of British boys stranded on a deserted island during wartime. Initially, the boys attempt to establish a civilized society, but as time progresses, they discover their primal instincts in the wild. With the emergence of the darker and savage aspects of human nature, the order on the island collapses, giving way to chaos among the boys. The novel serves as an allegory emphasizing the internal conflicts of human nature and highlighting the necessity of social order.</p>

       <br> In 1990, the second film adaptation was directed by Harry Hook. Unlike the first film, this one was shot in color and was not as successful. See Lord of the Flies (film, 1990).</p>
